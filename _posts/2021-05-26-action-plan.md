## Action Plan

I had a closer look and a deeper understanding of new knowledge after taking this course learning about Introduction to Science and Technology, specifically about how I could learn, use the GitHub website to hand in my reflective blog entries, and break Caesar Cypher code while reviewing previous ones such as avoiding plagiarism and giving appropriate presentations for the audience, which the tutor provided each week in class. For my academic plan, I want to gain more knowledge by reviewing all of the tutor recommendations in this course for my next class in Information Technology, and I want to improve my coding skills by reading more books related to my field and seeking more advice from the teacher when I have problems. My personal objective is to create the first game with simple content about choosing the suitable solution for the problem, I want to have it completed within two months by 26th August 2022, utilizing Python coding, which I have prior experience with. Furthermore, thanks to the GitHub website, which the tutor introduced, I discovered that there are various types of game engines in the GitHub marketplace provided by many users. As a result, I am able to set a short-term goal of exploring the website, fully mastering it, and gaining advanced knowledge from professionals in one month by July 22nd, 2022, in order to conduct additional research for my long-term goal of developing my first game.
